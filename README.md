# Demolition
 
_MainCamera having issues with the inspector with the mission demolition script
- shows no variables available for UI text, UI shots, and UI button which makes it not available to update the counts.

I also followed the book directions for clouds but cannot find out the reason they aren't initializing when the game is created.

"Making the game cooler": N/A
